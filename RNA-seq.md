**RNA-Seq is a widely used sequencing method in next-generation sequencing technologies. This method allows for the measurement of gene expression and the detection of gene transcripts, which can help in understanding gene and, consequently, protein function and quantity. RNA-Seq is highly significant in cancer research by determining the type of cancer, understanding drug resistance, determining the type of mutation, and planning the treatment. It enables the detection of mutations in genes and serves as a guide for detailed investigation. Additionally, it is crucial for profiling cancer types, developing risk assessments, and formulating drug strategies. Post-treatment sequencing allows for monitoring the responses to therapy.**

**RNA-Seq begins with sample collection, where the initial material, such as biopsy samples from cancer cells (ffpet), cell-free DNA (liquid biopsy) or cell cultures, is determined. Following sample collection, the RNA isolation phase is carried out. After RNA isolation, quality measurement is performed to clarify isolation. The quality control phase is critical for obtaining a high-quality library and for minimizing errors during sequencing. During this phase, the quantity, purity, and integrity of the RNA are assessed. Due to the instability of RNA molecules, cDNA is synthesized for library preparation. cDNA synthesis and library preparation help to stabilize the RNA and provide a more robust and measurable sample. Adaptors and indexes are added for sequencing. After that, purification and amplification processes are conducted to obtain pure and enough library. Sequencing is then performed using high-precision sequencing devices. Although different sequencing devices have various protocols, the fundamental process involves sequencing the DNA sequence, separating adaptors and indexes, and differentiating the sequence for each sample.**

**At the end of sequencing, raw data, bcl data format, is obtained. Analyzing, reading, and interpreting this data requires expertise. First, the data is converted into the Fastq format necessary for secondary analysis. This stage also involves quality control, where regions with low reads or low-quality reads are removed. Subsequently, various data analysis methods are used to compare the clean data against a reference genome and match it with mutation types in the literature. The use of this data varies depending on the purpose. Some mutations can be associated with diseases, while others might be used for drug resistance or diagnostic validation.**
